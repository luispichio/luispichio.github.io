Processing Services is embedded software running on ORBCOMM terminals (ST/IDP series).
It collects data from sources like Modbus, J1939, EIO or AVL Agent, processes it locally using configurable logic, statistics and transformations, and generates optimized output.
Reports are efficiently sent via satellite or cellular, minimizing bandwidth usage.
Processing Services also handles alarms, events, and LINs, enabling reliable, traceable, and autonomous edge intelligence for remote IoT deployments.
